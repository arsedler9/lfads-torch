abstract: >-
  Latent factor analysis via dynamical systems (LFADS) is an
  RNN-based variational sequential autoencoder that achieves
  state-of-the-art performance in denoising high-dimensional
  neural activity for downstream applications in science and
  engineering. Recently introduced variants and extensions
  continue to demonstrate the applicability of the
  architecture to a wide variety of problems in
  neuroscience. Since the development of the original
  implementation of LFADS, new technologies have emerged
  that use dynamic computation graphs, minimize boilerplate
  code, compose model configuration files, and simplify
  large-scale training. Building on these modern Python
  libraries, we introduce lfads-torch -- a new open-source
  implementation of LFADS that unifies existing variants and
  is designed to be easier to understand, configure, and
  extend. Documentation, source code, and issue tracking are
  available at: https://github.com/arsedler9/lfads-torch.
